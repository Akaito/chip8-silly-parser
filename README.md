Silly test implementation of a CHIP-8 assembler.  Written in Python using regex.

This code is a "pug".  Like the breed of dog, reasonable debate can be had on whether or not making it was a good idea.  But even so, there's something enjoyable about it.


TODO
----

- [ ] Support labels for jumps, instead of relying on manually figuring out addresses.
- [ ] Maybe: implement remaining popular (but not 1972-official) opcodes.
